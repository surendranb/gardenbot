## 🏛️ 1. WORLD MODEL CONSTRAINTS (The Indoor Truth)
(The Biome)
 *Codified March 27, 2026. Use for semantic reasoning/divergence analysis.*
 
 ### **A. LIGHTING GEOMETRY**
 - **Primary Window**: North-facing, 2m distance. Diffuse, stable light. **Zero direct sunlight ever.**
 - **Wall Orientation**: Plants against East-facing wall. Complete shield against morning UV entry.
 - **Camera LED**: Always ON. Provides persistent cool-spectrum fill light.
 
 ### **B. ATMOSPHERIC MICROCLIMATE**
 - **Climate Hierarchy (Human-Gated)**:
    - **Fan S (South)**: Always ON when the human is present. Baseline air exchange.
    - **Fan N (North)**: Auxiliary cooling for additional heat management.
    - **AC (Last Resort)**: Activated (26°C) only when fans are insufficient.
 - **Aerodynamics**: High air exchange prevents stagnant boundary layers; expect high VPD when fans are scoured.
 - **Thermal Gain**: Room is on the 1st floor with an open terrace above. Expect solar-thermal radiation from the ceiling during peak hours (12:00-15:00).
 
 ### **C. PHYSICAL LAYOUT**
 - **Desk Surface**: Wooden (Insulating). Low thermal conduction from desk to pots.
 - **Spatial Density**: P1 is isolated in the yellow pot. P2 and P4 share the same black pot and sensor channel (`a5`). P3 is in its own black pot. The white rabbit sits in the Pothos (`p3`) pot and serves as the visual scale anchor.
 
 ### **D. HUMAN FACTOR**
 - **Occupancy**: Human present 09:00 - 23:00 daily (12+ hours).
 - **Impact**: Localized CO2 enrichment and thermal mass (body heat) within 1m of the desk.
 
 ### **E. HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN CARE**
 - **Divergence Logic**: Reconcile AC-induced dryness vs. metabolic drought. 
 - **VPD Divergence**: Expect indoor humidity to be 30-40% lower than outdoor forecasts due to AC dehumidification and fan scouring.

## 🧠 2. SEMANTIC FACT SYNTHESIS (The Warden's Logic)
- **VPD State**: EXTREME (Critical Stress) at 3.518 kPa (Rising trend: 0.194).
- **Hydration Stagnancy**: p1 is flat (Δ2.8%). Check for root-stasis or sensor drift.
- **Hydration Stagnancy**: p2 is flat (Δ2.9%). Check for root-stasis or sensor drift.
- **Hydration Stagnancy**: p3 is flat (Δ2.9%). Check for root-stasis or sensor drift.
- **Human Occupancy**: HIGH. Fan S (South) is active; localized air exchange is manual.

## 🛠️ 3. RECENT HUMAN INTERVENTIONS
- **[2026-04-04 11:30]**: watered p1

## 🪴 LATEST REPORT (from CSV): 2026-04-02 06:26 AM IST

* **P1:** Healthy - Alignment (sensor shows 100% moisture, visuals show stable growth) ➔ **Advice:** Maintain current care; continue to monitor for VPD stress.
* **P2:** Stressed - Divergence (Sensor A5 broken/frozen at 100%; visual confirmation shows declining vibrancy, drooping, and potential dehydration) ➔ **Advice:** HARDWARE ISSUE: Ignore A5 sensor data for p2 and p4. Visually assess for watering needs.
* **P3:** Stable - Alignment (sensor shows 80.6% moisture, visuals show consistent stasis) ➔ **Advice:** Maintain current care; plant resilient despite high VPD.
* **P4:** Stressed - Divergence (Sensor A5 broken/frozen at 100%; visual confirmation shows minimal change but shares p2's sensor issues) ➔ **Advice:** HARDWARE ISSUE: Ignore A5 sensor data for p2 and p4. Visually assess for watering needs.

### 🌡️ Biome Dynamics
* **VPD Context:** VPD at 3.376 kPa (EXTREME) continues to be the primary environmental stressor.
* **Verdict:** A5 sensor (p2/p4) is non-functional, providing misleading 100% moisture readings. Visuals indicate p2 is stressed, overriding sensor data. P1 and P3 remain stable.

## 🪴 Garden Observer Report - 2026-04-03 06:03 PM IST
* **p1 (String of Nickels):** Healthy - Alignment (sensor shows 85.3% moisture adequate and visuals show stable, turgid growth) ➔ **Advice:** Continue foliar misting to mitigate VPD stress; monitor for any changes
* **p2 (Mexican Mint):** Stressed - Divergence (sensor shows 82.7% moisture adequate but visuals show leaf margin dehydration and drooping) ➔ **Advice:** HARDWARE ISSUE: Ignore A5 sensor data. Visually assess for watering needs; check for root-zone compaction.
* **p3 (Pothos):** Stable - Alignment (sensor shows 64.4% moisture adequate and visuals show only slight tip necrosis) ➔ **Advice:** Maintain current care; monitor lesion for changes; consider humidity support for VPD stress.
* **p4 (Silver Guest):** Fragile - Divergence (sensor data unreliable due to A5 failure; visuals show significant loss of leaf color and structural integrity) ➔ **Advice:** HARDWARE ISSUE: Ignore A5 sensor data. Increase light exposure; inspect for nutrient deficiency; ensure proper establishment; consider separate potting.

## 🌡️ Biome Dynamics
* **VPD Context:** VPD at 3.622 kPa (EXTREME, stable trend) indicates high atmospheric demand driving transpiration stress.
* **The Warden's Verdict:** Extreme VPD continues as primary stressor. p1 shows resilience with alignment. p2 and p4 show visual stress indicating hydration/light issues compounded by A5 sensor failure. p3 shows mild visual stress likely from VPD despite adequate soil moisture.

## ℹ️ FINAL INSTRUCTIONS TO OBSERVER
- **World Awareness**: Use Section 1 to interpret Section 2 & 3. Do not assume sensors are drifting if they diverge from Section 5.
- **Microclimate Priority**: Periodic AC (26°C) and Fans define the physical state.
- **Actionable Insight**: Provide a hypothesis for any "Care Detected" vs. "Dry-down" events.
- **Vision Priority**: Use Section 7 as the structured visual ground truth for current appearance and temporal changes.
