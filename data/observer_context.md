## 🏛️ 1. WORLD MODEL CONSTRAINTS (The Indoor Truth)
(The Biome)
 *Codified March 27, 2026. Use for semantic reasoning/divergence analysis.*
 
 ### **A. LIGHTING GEOMETRY**
 - **Primary Window**: North-facing, 2m distance. Diffuse, stable light. **Zero direct sunlight ever.**
 - **Wall Orientation**: Plants against East-facing wall. Complete shield against morning UV entry.
 - **Camera LED**: Always ON. Provides persistent cool-spectrum fill light.
 
 ### **B. ATMOSPHERIC MICROCLIMATE**
 - **Climate Hierarchy (Human-Gated)**:
    - **Fan S (South)**: Always ON when the human is present. Baseline air exchange.
    - **Fan N (North)**: Auxiliary cooling for additional heat management.
    - **AC (Last Resort)**: Activated (26°C) only when fans are insufficient.
 - **Aerodynamics**: High air exchange prevents stagnant boundary layers; expect high VPD when fans are scoured.
 - **Thermal Gain**: Room is on the 1st floor with an open terrace above. Expect solar-thermal radiation from the ceiling during peak hours (12:00-15:00).
 
 ### **C. PHYSICAL LAYOUT**
 - **Desk Surface**: Wooden (Insulating). Low thermal conduction from desk to pots.
 - **Spatial Density**: P1 is isolated in the yellow pot. P2 and P4 share the same black pot and sensor channel (`a5`). P3 is in its own black pot. The white rabbit sits in the Pothos (`p3`) pot and serves as the visual scale anchor.
 
 ### **D. HUMAN FACTOR**
 - **Occupancy**: Human present 09:00 - 23:00 daily (12+ hours).
 - **Impact**: Localized CO2 enrichment and thermal mass (body heat) within 1m of the desk.
 
 ### **E. HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN CARE**
 - **Divergence Logic**: Reconcile AC-induced dryness vs. metabolic drought. 
 - **VPD Divergence**: Expect indoor humidity to be 30-40% lower than outdoor forecasts due to AC dehumidification and fan scouring.

## 🧠 2. SEMANTIC FACT SYNTHESIS (The Warden's Logic)
- **VPD State**: EXTREME (Critical Stress) at 3.233 kPa (Stable trend: 0.047).
- **Hydration Stagnancy**: p1 is flat (Δ-0.3%). Check for root-stasis or sensor drift.
- **Hydration Stagnancy**: p2 is flat (Δ0.0%). Check for root-stasis or sensor drift.
- **Dry-down**: p3 moisture velocity is -15.1% per window. Metabolic activity is active.
- **Human Occupancy**: HIGH. Fan S (South) is active; localized air exchange is manual.

## 📖 6. PREVIOUS LEDGER ENTRIES (Last 3)
## 🪴 Individual Plant Status
* **p1 (String of Nickels):** Healthy - Alignment (sensor shows 100% moisture adequate and visuals show healthy, turgid growth) ➔ **Advice:** Continue foliar misting to mitigate VPD stress; monitor for any changes
* **p2 (Mexican Mint):** Stressed - Divergence (sensor shows 100% moisture adequate but visuals show chlorosis/yellowing) ➔ **Advice:** Investigate nutrient deficiency or light stress; consider reducing watering if over-saturation suspected
* **p3 (Pothos):** Stable - Alignment (sensor shows 60.4% moisture adequate and visuals show stable necrotic lesion) ➔ **Advice:** Maintain current care; monitor lesion for changes; consider humidity support for VPD stress
* **p4 (Silver Guest):** Fragile - Divergence (sensor shows ample moisture (inferred from p2) but visuals show limited growth and establishment) ➔ **Advice:** Increase light exposure; inspect for nutrient deficiency; ensure proper establishment; consider separate potting

---

## 🌡️ Biome Dynamics
* **VPD Context:** VPD at 3.186 kPa (EXTREME range) indicates high atmospheric demand driving transpiration stress despite adequate soil moisture.
* **The Warden's Verdict:** Soil moisture remains ample across all plants, but extreme VPD drives transpiration stress; visual stress on p2 (chlorosis) and p4 (limited growth) diverges from sensor readings, suggesting issues beyond hydration (nutrient/light stress for p2, establishment/light for p4). p1 and p3 show alignment and remain stable.

---

## 💾 STATE UPDATE (INTERNAL)
- **NEW_HYPOTHESIS**: The persistent high VPD is likely causing transpiration stress that is manifesting as chlorosis in p2 and stunted growth in p4, despite adequate soil moisture.
- **LAST_HUMAN_ACTION**: misted p1
- **ACTIVE CONCERNS**: high-vpd, p2-nutrient-light-stress, p4-establishment-light

## ℹ️ FINAL INSTRUCTIONS TO OBSERVER
- **World Awareness**: Use Section 1 to interpret Section 2 & 3. Do not assume sensors are drifting if they diverge from Section 5.
- **Microclimate Priority**: Periodic AC (26°C) and Fans define the physical state.
- **Actionable Insight**: Provide a hypothesis for any "Care Detected" vs. "Dry-down" events.
- **Vision Priority**: Use Section 7 as the structured visual ground truth for current appearance and temporal changes.
